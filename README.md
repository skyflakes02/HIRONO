GRAPHICS

TYPES OF CELLS
-> The Brick Cell: Shooting this turns it into a cracked brick cell. Hitting it again destroys it completely.
-> The Stone Cell: A permanent wall; shooting this does nothing.  
-> The Mirror Cell: Bullets will be reflected depending on the cell's orientation.
-> The Water Cell: A permanent wall, but bullets can pass through.
-> The Forest Cell: Provides partial camouflage.
-> The Home Cell: The cell you must protect. Once destroyed, the game ends regardless of the remaining lives.

ENEMY TANKS
With only 2 lives, your task is to shoot and destroy every enemy tank.
Hitting an enemy tank returns it to its spawn point. Destroy any tank and reach 6 kills to win.

YOUR TANK
An enemy tank hitting you decreases your life by 1 and returns you to your spawn point.
Powerups are available. Pick these up to increase your life by 1.

By following these instructions, you should be ready to navigate through the stages, defeat enemies, and experience the full gameplay of the game. Adjust to the challenges presented in each stage and aim for victory while preserving your tank's integrity!
